# tabular_scrapper 
This simple python script was developed for scrapping cripto currency prices which are displayed in tabular form on a variety of webpages. 
The script is intended for general use by allowing one to extract and export data either to a numpy array or .csv file. 
Because there's a wide range of html stuctures and formatting, it's up to the user to inspect the desired page elements and format adequately the raw data into a workable format.
